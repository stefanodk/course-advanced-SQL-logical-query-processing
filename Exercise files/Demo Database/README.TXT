This folder hosts the animal shelter demo database used in my LinkedIn Learning "Advanced SQL - Query Processing" course.
This is what you'll need to follow along the demos and solve the exercises.

If you are looking for the generic repository for this database, see https://github.com/ami-levin/Animal_Shelter.
